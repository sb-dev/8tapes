Le duo embarque le théâtre antique de Fourvière dans une expérience qui va le faire planer loin, très loin.\n\nARTE Concert vous propose le meilleur de la scène européenne sur tous vos écrans : http://concert.arte.tv\n\nRetrouvez-nous aussi sur les réseaux sociaux :\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/ARTEConcert\nTwitter https://twitter.com/ARTEconcertFR\nInstagram http://instagram.com/arteconcert"}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT1H18M43S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"false","licensedContent":true,"projection":"rectangular"},"statistics":{"viewCount":"310794","likeCount":"8736","dislikeCount":"95","favoriteCount":"0","commentCount":"162"},"topicDetails":{"topicIds":["/m/04rlf"],"relevantTopicIds":["/m/04rlf"],"topicCategories":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"]}},{"kind":"youtube#video","etag":"\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/PuU7XCm3Ds2zk_BR0tC7Ncpax5U\"","id":"3Ww2TP_tU7o","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-09-21T22:00:00.000Z","channelId":"UCecNr3pN9N6kJn3Y6m9W8Rw","title":"Next Gen Farming Without Soil and 90% Less Water  | GRATEFUL","description":"Aeroponics grows fruits and vegetables faster, cheaper and better.

RAY DALTON (OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO)","description":"Macklemore & Ryan Lewis present the official music video for Can't Hold Us feat. Ray Dalton. \n\nCan't Hold Us on iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/cant-hold-us-feat.-ray-dalton/id560097651?i=560097694\nThe Heist CD deluxe edition: http://www.macklemoremerch.com\nThe Heist digital deluxe on iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-heist-deluxe-edition/id560097651\nThe Heist on Amazon: http://amzn.com/B00908DDZM\nThe Heist in-stores NOW!\n\nNote from Ryan Lewis:\n\nIt seems like when a music video comes out, the title that receives all of the credit and travels with a film is that of the director. It's as though the director is the \"artist\" or \"creator\" of the music video, when in reality a music video is first a written treatment, produced (putting together ingredients like actors and locations), shot and directed, cut on the editing board and finally color graded. The music might be fine tuned and scored specifically for that film. There are so many variables that are completely equal if not sometimes more complicated than directing, it's a shame that so much credit comes down to whoever fulfills that position. A director wouldn't have shit to direct without a producer. A producer would have nothing to produce without a writer, and so forth. \n\nFor our team, I think it's even more complicated because roles tend to cross over. We simply don't work within the conventional hierarchy of the film industry (director, producer, etc.) Sure, people have concrete pre-defined roles based on their expertise, but our team has the remarkable ability to wear multiple hats. Can't Hold Us was a video that showcased this well. \n\nAfter three months of shooting, finally getting to those last few frames where you reveal the credits, it's a tense moment. There isn't exactly a sensible way to do it, if we're trying to fit people into classic film roles. It leads me to the point that although we do our best to give people titles, this was a video fully created by seven individuals at the forefront. Take any of those people out of the equation, you'd be watching a very different video. I write this in hopes that you don't fall under the illusion that one person creates a music video, particularly at the Macklemore camp.

The measurements and recipes below are purposely created so you can whip up a small 250mL batch of cocktail syrup(s) for your next mixing session. Most recipes you'll find online and in cocktail books seem to detail how to make bar-like quantities of syrup that you simply won't be able to finish before it spoils - we've made it a little easier.\n\nAre you are looking for an Orgeat or Grenadine recipe? Subscribe to my YouTube channel, these recipes are coming soon!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/StevetheBartenderAUS?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWHAT DRINKS CAN I MAKE WITH THESE COCKTAIL SYRUPS?\n\nRASPBERRY \nClover Club - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1v-1QchxcY\nKnickerbocker - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf_3ZY9AAPY\nFlorodora - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PiIvv_iAY\n\nMINT\nMojito - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NANdz-YKMUw\nMint Julep - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ9CQ_R1GsY\nWhiskey Smash - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ofp-QQbsaG8\nSouthside - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y1BCamJrR4\n\nGINGER\nDark & Stormy - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT43iTg0RYQ\nMoscow Mule - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7X-AeGHPcE\nPenicillin - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYixmx56Agk\nFlorodora - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3PiIvv_iAY\nSpicy Mojito\n\nHONEY\nBees Knees - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhEmMwUMINI\nGold Rush - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSCROmIjhjc\nPenicillin - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYixmx56Agk\n\nSIMPLE SYRUP (1:1)\nSimple syrup doesn't take long to make, even on the stove top. If you are in a mad rush to get sipping on a daiquiri, you can simply combine sugar and water in a bottle and shake. It will take a little bit of shaking but the sugar will incorporate and if you use hot water, it will work even quicker. The advantage of creating a simple syrup this way is the fact that it saves a little time and you don't need a stove top.\n\nWhy wouldn't I always use this method you ask? Well, the boiling of the simple syrup actually breaks down the sucrose (sugar) into two different molecules, fructose and glucose which creates a slightly sweeter syrup. The key reason I like to create my syrup on the stove top though is to extend it's shelf life.\n\nCreates 250mL of Simple Syrup:\n- 150g Water (we prefer to weigh the ingredients)\n- 150g White Sugar\nBring to the boil for the sugar to dissolve.\n\nRASPBERRY SYRUP\nRaspberries are a soft fruit so it isn't necessary to heat them on a stove top (unless you would like to increase the shelf life of your syrup). Simply add one punnet of raspberries to your simple syrup, muddle, steep and strain.\n\nCreates 250mL of Raspberry Syrup:\n- 250mL Simple Syrup (1:1)\n- 125g Raspberries (1 x punnet)\nCombine the two ingredients and muddle the raspberries. Leave in the fridge overnight before straining out the raspberries, leaving a bright and rich tasting syrup.\n\nMINT SYRUP\nMint, like other soft herbs, are best incorporated by steeping within a 1:1 simple syrup. The steeping time will vary dependent on the temperature of the syrup (if it just came off the stove) and how much mint you use. We recommend steeping it for at least a few hours or overnight in the fridge.\n\nCreates 250mL of Mint Syrup:\n- 250mL Simple Syrup (1:1)\n- 20+ Mint Leaves\nCombine the two ingredients. Steep overnight before straining out the mint.\n\nGINGER SYRUP\nGinger syrup is a great way to incorporate some spice and aromatics into a drink. This syrup takes a little more time then the ones listed above but is still relatively easy to make. If you have a juicer then you are all set as you can simply extract the juice, add sugar and heat it on the stove. As per the video, we ran through using a blender (which is more common for most households to have).\n\nYou can use young ginger for fresher, vibrant and aromatic level of spice. Old ginger will create more heat in your syrup.\n\nCreates 250mL+ of Ginger Syrup:\n- 250mL Simple Syrup\n- 100g Fresh Ginger\nBlend the ginger (add a little water or simple syrup to help break it down). Combine the simple syrup and blended ginger to the stove top. Bring to the boil. Let cool before straining out the ginger (using a strainer, cheese cloth, etc.).\n\nHONEY SYRUP (3:1)\nEver tried adding honey to a cocktail? It does work out too well. As the honey hits the ice or cold liquid, it hardens and doesn't incorporate within the drink. The solution? A little dilution prior to mixing.\n\nCreates 200mL of Honey Syrup:\n150mL Honey\n50mL Warm Water\nCombine honey and warm water. Stir to combine.\n\nMusic by Julian Avila - Inspired: https://soundcloud.com/julian_avila/inspired","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/01Vsc0hWhxc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/01Vsc0hWhxc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/01Vsc0hWhxc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/01Vsc0hWhxc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/01Vsc0hWhxc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Steve the Bartender","tags":["cocktail syrups","cocktail syrup recipe","simple syrup","sugar syrup","invert syrup","rich syrup","rich simple syrup","fruit syrup","raspberry syrup","ginger syrup","mint syrup","sugar syrup recipe","simple syrup recipe","honey syrup","raspberry cocktails","ginger cocktails","honey cocktails","mint cocktails","clover club","knickerbocker","mojito","mint julep","whiskey smash","southside","moscow mule","penicillin","bees knees","gold rush","cocktails","drink syrup","cocktail syrup"],"categoryId":"26","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"ESSENTIAL COCKTAIL SYRUPS 101 - Raspberry, Ginger, Honey!","description":"I've compiled a list of some of the essential cocktail syrups for making many classic and modern cocktails.

And roll it to 1cm thickness. \n\n8. 원형커터(지름 8cm)로 동그랗게 잘라내고, 반죽위에 면보를 덮어 30분간 발효해줍니다.\n8. Cut the dough using a round cookie cutter(8cm), cover with cheese cloth or plastic warp and rest for 30min. \n\n쿠키커터로 자르고 남은 반죽을 다시 하나로 만들어 7-8번의 과정을 반복해줍니다.\nBall up the scrap dough and repeat steps 7 to 8. \n\n9. 냄비에 기름을 넣어 170℃로 예열하고, 반죽을 넣어 1-2분씩 양면 골고루 튀겨줍니다.\n9. Pour and heat oil into a pot at 170℃. Add and fry for 1 ~ 2min each side until golden brown.\n\n10. 기름에서 도넛을 꺼내 망 위에 올려 식혀줍니다..\n10. Remove from the oil, place it on frying tray or paper towel.\n\n11. 칼을 이용해 도넛에 작은 구멍을 내고, 미리 만들어 둔 바닐라 커스타드 크림을 채워줍니다.\n11. Slit the doughnut for the filling using a knife, fill the doughnuts with the custard cream. \n\n12. 도넛 겉에 설탕을 묻혀줍니다. \n12. Coat the doughnuts in sugar. Done! \n\n설탕을 먼저 묻히고 크림을 나중에 채워도 상관없어요. 편한 순서대로 하세요.\nThe order of filling and dusting doesn’t matter. Suit yourself\n완성한 도넛은 겉면이 마르지않도록 밀폐용기에 담아 보관해주세요.\nKeep the finished doughnuts in an airtight container to prevent drying out.

Use toothpicks stuck into the sweet potato to keep it slightly elevated from the bottom. \nPlace it in direct sunlight.\nReplace with clean water every one to two days.\nOnce the potatoes have roots and sprouts (called slips) about 4-5 inches long, twist the slips from the potato, and set them in their own bowl of shallow water.\nThe slips will begin growing their own roots, and once they are one inch long, you can plant them in soil. \n \n \nLettuce\n \nMATERIALS\n1 head lettuce\nMason jar or cup\nWater\n \nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. On a cutting board, cut two inches of the base of lettuce off.\n2. Set the lettuce on its base in a glass with ½ inch of water, and place it in sunlight. Change the water every day.\n3. After 5-7 days, some new leaves should have begun to sprout from the center, and roots should be forming. Transfer it to soil and you can begin harvesting leaves when they reach 6-8 inches tall.\n \n \n \n \n \nBok Choy\n \nMATERIALS\n1 head bok choy\nMason jar or cup\nWater\n \nINSTRUCTIONS\nOn a cutting board, cut the the 2-inch base of the bok choy.\nPlace the bok choy in a container with water and place in a sunny location.\nReplace with fresh water every day or two. Use a spray bottle to mist the center of the plant for extra hydration if necessary.\nWith time, the outside of the bok choy will deteriorate and turn yellow, while the center will grow turing from a pale green to darker green.\n When the bok choy has grown new leafy-growth at its center, transfer it to a container with potting mix. The container must have a good drainage hole.\nPlant the bok choy deep, so only the tips of the new green leaves pointing up.\nPlace in an area that gets at least 6 hours of sunlight a day. Bok choy requires a lot of water, so water generously.\n \n \n \nScallions\n \nMATERIALS\n1 bunch scallions\nMason jar or cup\nWater\n \nINSTRUCTIONS\nOn a cutting board, trim the base of the scallions, keeping approximately 2 inches of the roots and base intact.\nPlace the roots in ½ inch of water with sunlight. Change the water every other day.\nTransfer to soil after 5-7 days or keep in the glass of water. You can begin harvesting when they are fully grown.\n \n \n \nOnions\n \nMATERIALS\n1 red or yellow onion\nPot\nSoil\n \nINSTRUCTIONS\nTrim the base of the onion into a cube, keeping 1-2 inches of the root base intact. \nPlant the onion directly into soil with a thin layer of soil covering the cut top. To make room in your garden, you can trim the sides of the onion as only the center is needed for regrowth.\nHarvest the onions when the green tops have yellowed and fallen over.\n \n \n \nGinger\n \nMATERIALS\n1 knob of ginger\nBaking dish\nWater\nPot\nSoil\n \nINSTRUCTIONS\nPlace the ginger in a baking dish and soak it in warm water for overnight.\nGinger roots grow horizontally so fill a shallow, wide plant pot with rich, well-draining potting soil.\nIf you want more than one plant, you can cut the root into pieces, as long as they are at least an inch long (each should each still have at least 3 “eyes”), and as long as each plant has at least 8 inches of its own space in the pot.\nPlant the ginger with the eye bud pointing up below 1-2 inches of soil.\nWater lightly (often, but not so that it is over soaked) and keep in a warm place, though not one with huge amounts of direct sunlight per day.\nIt will take a few months before the ginger is large enough to begin harvesting pieces from it.\n \n \n \n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/17351\n\n\nMUSIC\nLicensed via Audio Network\n\nSTILLS\nThe Rapid Growth Of Spring Onions, Time-Lapse\naleksask/Getty Images","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jt8QdgxuAsQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jt8QdgxuAsQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jt8QdgxuAsQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jt8QdgxuAsQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jt8QdgxuAsQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Tasty","tags":["BuzzFeed","Tasty","how to","easy","simple","diy","regrow vegetables","green thumb","mini garden","at home","water","soil","small spaces","indoor gardening","Tasty Vegetarian"],"categoryId":"26","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"Easiest Vegetables to Grow In a Small Space","description":"Here is what you'll need!\n\n \nHow To Regrow Vegetables From Your Kitchen\n \n \nPotatoes\n \nMATERIALS\n1 sweet potato\n1 yellow potato\nToothpicks\nMason jar or cups\nWater\n \nINSTRUCTIONS \nHalve the sweet potatoes, and place cut side down in a jar filled with water.

To make room in your garden, you can trim the sides of the onion as only the center is needed for regrowth.\nHarvest the onions when the green tops have yellowed and fallen over.\n \n \n \nGinger\n \nMATERIALS\n1 knob of ginger\nBaking dish\nWater\nPot\nSoil\n \nINSTRUCTIONS\nPlace the ginger in a baking dish and soak it in warm water for overnight.\nGinger roots grow horizontally so fill a shallow, wide plant pot with rich, well-draining potting soil.\nIf you want more than one plant, you can cut the root into pieces, as long as they are at least an inch long (each should each still have at least 3 “eyes”), and as long as each plant has at least 8 inches of its own space in the pot.\nPlant the ginger with the eye bud pointing up below 1-2 inches of soil.\nWater lightly (often, but not so that it is over soaked) and keep in a warm place, though not one with huge amounts of direct sunlight per day.\nIt will take a few months before the ginger is large enough to begin harvesting pieces from it.\n \n \n \n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/17351\n\n\nMUSIC\nLicensed via Audio Network\n\nSTILLS\nThe Rapid Growth Of Spring Onions, Time-Lapse\naleksask/Getty Images"}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT1M40S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"false","licensedContent":true,"projection":"rectangular"},"statistics":{"viewCount":"8476106","likeCount":"56702","dislikeCount":"1743","favoriteCount":"0","commentCount":"625"},"topicDetails":{"relevantTopicIds":["/m/019_rr","/m/02wbm","/m/019_rr","/m/02wbm"],"topicCategories":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"]}},{"kind":"youtube#video","etag":"\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/fuw-ZCqsb_oq7v--OdIHHFyuHEk\"","id":"gpNWLo76sio","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-12-07T17:00:09.000Z","channelId":"UCDIdCb7LL0cA8EBbY_6njaw","title":"Rohff - J'arrache tout [Clip Officiel]","description":"J'ARRACHE TOUT // 2ème extrait de SURNATUREL ! \nSortie nationale de l'album le 14.12.2018\nPrécommande l'album ici : https://lnk.to/Rohff-Surnaturel\n\nAbonne-toi à la chaîne : http://bit.ly/2lWnCcB\n\nEcoute \"J'ARRACHE TOUT\" partout : https://lnk.to/Rohff-JArracheTout \n\nPlus d'infos :\n\nSnapchat : https://www.snapchat.com/add/realrohff\nFacebook : https://www.facebook.com/OfficielRohff\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/rohff?lang=fr\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/surnaturelbyrohff/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gpNWLo76sio/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gpNWLo76sio/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gpNWLo76sio/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gpNWLo76sio/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gpNWLo76sio/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Rohff","tags":["j'arrache tout","Rohff","Hip Hop","Legend Alive Production","94","Rap","French hip hop","clip officiel"],"categoryId":"10","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"Rohff - J'arrache tout [Clip Officiel]","description":"J'ARRACHE TOUT // 2ème extrait de SURNATUREL ! \nSortie nationale de l'album le 14.12.2018\nPrécommande l'album ici : https://lnk.to/Rohff-Surnaturel\n\nAbonne-toi à la chaîne : http://bit.ly/2lWnCcB\n\nEcoute \"J'ARRACHE TOUT\" partout : https://lnk.to/Rohff-JArracheTout \n\nPlus d'infos :\n\nSnapchat : https://www.snapchat.com/add/realrohff\nFacebook : https://www.facebook.com/OfficielRohff\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/rohff?lang=fr\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/surnaturelbyrohff/"},"defaultAudioLanguage":"fr"},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT3M15S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"false","licensedContent":true,"projection":"rectangular"},"statistics":{"viewCount":"2945426","likeCount":"38345","dislikeCount":"2547","favoriteCount":"0","commentCount":"3927"},"topicDetails":{"relevantTopicIds":["/m/0glt670","/m/04rlf","/m/04rlf","/m/0glt670"],"topicCategories":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music"]}},{"kind":"youtube#video","etag":"\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/ZQ-jbKSJDwEJNxa6ljhWrGFyNhk\"","id":"7bJwHYZnaiQ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-12-03T02:33:59.000Z","channelId":"UCgPClNr5VSYC3syrDUIlzLw","title":"Dream Sequence | DREAM CORP LLC | adult swim","description":"Watch free episodes: http://asw.im/8n2Eco \nEnter two seasons worth of therapeutic nightmares.

I know there's a ton of nonalcoholic recipes out there for Butterbeer and those are fine, but honestly, I think this is more in line with what J.K. Rowling had in mind when she wrote the books.

Thirdly, Butterbeer is an actual real thing, found in a Tudor cookbook from 1588.  Was J.K. Rowling specifically referencing this recipe?  I can't say for sure (unless she wants to answer!) but I CAN say that I was shocked to discover that Nicolas Flamel was a real person, who wrote a book on alchemy and the creation of the Philosophers Stone.

A global retreat from meat could have a far-reaching environmental impact.\n\nClick here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: https://econ.st/2xvTKdy \n\nBy 2050 the world's population could approach 10 billion - and around 60% more food could be needed to feed everyone. The environmental impacts of the food system are daunting its responsible for about a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions and uses about 70% of all freshwater resources, and it occupies about 40% of the Earth's land surface.\n\nFood rated emissions could increase to 50 percent by 2050 and fill up the total emissions budget that we have in order to avoid dangerous levels of climate change.\n\nInterest in vegan food has been booming across the rich world. A major study has put the diet to the test -  analyzing an imagined scenario in which the world goes vegan by 2050.

A global retreat from meat could have a far-reaching environmental impact.\n\nClick here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: https://econ.st/2xvTKdy \n\nBy 2050 the world's population could approach 10 billion - and around 60% more food could be needed to feed everyone. The environmental impacts of the food system are daunting its responsible for about a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions and uses about 70% of all freshwater resources, and it occupies about 40% of the Earth's land surface.\n\nFood rated emissions could increase to 50 percent by 2050 and fill up the total emissions budget that we have in order to avoid dangerous levels of climate change.\n\nInterest in vegan food has been booming across the rich world. A major study has put the diet to the test -  analyzing an imagined scenario in which the world goes vegan by 2050. If everybody went vegan by 2050 we estimated that food-related greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced by 3/4.\n\nCows are the biggest emission contributors. Bugs in their digestive system produce methane and deforestation for their pasture releases carbon dioxide - these gases warm the planet.

The episode follows Jake as he attempts to avoid capture by the Immortan and her horde while simultaneously testing the viability of surviving Fury Road and all the challenges it presents.

It's the first time he's performed tracks from his new album, Swimming, in front of an audience. On \"2009,\" he rubbed his chin with clinched eyes, looking like a young man who's beginning to crack the code. Backed by a piano loop and a string quartet, he reflected on his journey's peaks and valleys thus far.\n\nI ain't asking why no more\nI know I'll take it if it's mine\nI don't stay inside the lines\nIt ain't 2009 no more\nYeah, I know what's behind that door\n\nWith nearly a decade under his belt at 26 years old, these words ring like an artist twice his age.\n\nWe were introduced to Mac Miller via 2011's XXL Freshman Class, which featured a special crop of MCs such as Kendrick Lamar, Meek Mill and YG, all of whom are now considered in the upper echelon of hip-hop. After his big splash, he's been able to find a groove and consistently release quality rap records, ultimately keeping his name in the conversation with the other young greats. His 2011 album, Blue Slide Park, reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200, the first independently distributed debut album to do so since 1995's Dogg Food by Tha Dogg Pound. These consecutive triumphs amassed plenty of fame, fortune and insurmountable obstacles, causing a stumble here and there. Throughout the years, however, Mac has brushed himself off and put it in the music.\n\nFor this performance, Mac Miller invited frequent collaborator Thundercat, who graced the Tiny Desk last year and will join Mac on tour this fall. Thundercat put on a dazzling shaker routine and played the deep centerpiece bass line on \"What's The Use?\" These Swimming iterations don't veer far away from the recorded versions, but here, his lyrics seem easier to interpret under live instrumentation.\n\nSet List\n\"Small Worlds\"\n\"What's the Use? (Feat.

Throughout the years, however, Mac has brushed himself off and put it in the music.\n\nFor this performance, Mac Miller invited frequent collaborator Thundercat, who graced the Tiny Desk last year and will join Mac on tour this fall. Thundercat put on a dazzling shaker routine and played the deep centerpiece bass line on \"What's The Use?\" These Swimming iterations don't veer far away from the recorded versions, but here, his lyrics seem easier to interpret under live instrumentation.\n\nSet List\n\"Small Worlds\"\n\"What's the Use? (Feat. Thundercat)\"\n\"2009\"\n\nMusicians\nMac Miller (Vocals), Thundercat (Bass), Justus West (Guitar), Klynik (Keys), Joe Cleveland (Bass), Kendall Lewis (Drums), Robin Fay-Massie (Violin), YaShauna Swan (2nd Violin), Lelia Walker (Viola), Melanie Hsu (Cello)\n\nCredits\nProducers: Bobby Carter, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, CJ Riculan, Beck Harlan, Khun Minn Ohn; Production Assistants: Catherine Zhang, Téa Mottolese; Photo: Eslah Attar/NPR."},"defaultAudioLanguage":"en"},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT17M10S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"false","licensedContent":false,"projection":"rectangular"},"statistics":{"viewCount":"30949305","likeCount":"419761","dislikeCount":"10105","favoriteCount":"0","commentCount":"27746"},"topicDetails":{"relevantTopicIds":["/m/04rlf","/m/0glt670","/m/04rlf","/m/0glt670"],"topicCategories":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"]}},{"kind":"youtube#video","etag":"\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/g3_FMwfSnnESx2JFro42d6NpLFI\"","id":"YqvCptqhHfs","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-08-07T00:00:02.000Z","channelId":"UClRx3MMyYUyqOxyEqA5F2nQ","title":"Travis Scott - STOP TRYING TO BE GOD","description":"Featuring Philip Bailey, James Blake, Kid Cudi and Stevie Wonder on harmonica\n\nDirected by Dave Meyers\n\nASTROWORLD OUT NOW   http://travisscott.com\n\nTravis Scott online:\nhttps://twitter.com/trvisXX\nhttps://www.instagram.com/travisscott/\nhttps://soundcloud.com/travisscott-2\nhttps://www.facebook.com/travisscottlaflame\nhttps://travisscott.com/\n\nEpic / Cactus Jack\n(c) 2018 Epic Records, a division of Sony Music Entertainment.

Spécial Investigation","description":"La cybercriminalité est une nouvelle forme de délinquance, invisible mais redoutable, contre laquelle la police a le plus grand mal à lutter.

These secrets will help you to make your dishes taste just as great as Gordon Ramsay's (or even better!). \nHow do restaurant chefs manage to cook delicious culinary masterpieces so fast? Professional chefs usually keep all their cooking tricks a secret and share them only with their students. \n\nTIMESTAMPS\nThe perfect steak 0:47\nThe juiciest meat 1:31\nFlavoring spices 2:24\nLight and airy dough 3:05\nFish with a delicate crust 3:39\nCooking steak without oil 4:13\nCreamy mashed potatoes 4:41\nExcellent cream soup 5:29\nThe best pancakes 6:19\nSugar is not for sweetness 6:51\nThe most difficult one: perfectly fried eggs 7:15\nClear broth 8:10\nCrispy bread crust 9:06\nCook onions correctly 9:46\nDon't be afraid of garlic 10:32\n\nSUMMARY\n- Don't fry a piece of meat that you've just taken out of the fridge. Leave it for an hour or 2 before cooking to let it come up to room temperature. Now you'll fry the meat evenly and get a great meal, regardless of how you like your steak done. \n- It takes time to fry chicken or pork properly, and you can dry them out very easily. To avoid this, many European chefs use a simple trick: they put the meat in a brine. It's very easy to make a good brine: take 3 cups of water, and add ¼ cup of salt and ¼ cup of sugar. Pour the brine into your meat so that the liquid covers it, and put the bowl in a fridge.\n- To extract natural flavors and enhance the taste of the black pepper or cumin in your dish, toss them in a pan over medium heat, toasting them until they're fragrant. After that, you can use a mortar and pestle to grind your spices. \n- If you want to make it perfect, here is a simple rule. Take the butter and eggs out of the fridge the night before to let them come up to room temperature.\n- If you want to fry fish on a grill, spread some mayonnaise on it to get a tasty, delicate crust. Take a pastry brush, dip the tip in the sauce, and lightly apply mayo to the fish. Add some salt, and then grill it. \n- Alain Ducasse, one of the most famous chefs in the world, revealed his secret for cooking a great steak. The steak is placed on its edge because it renders the fat. Now you're able to cook the steak in beef fat, plus it creates a delicious crust on the edges. \n- Before turning boiled potatoes into the mashed ones, you need to dry them properly. Just place them in a clean heated frying pan, and keep them there until the remains of water dry out. Don't let the heat fry them. When the potatoes are dry, you'll get the best creamy mashed potatoes.\n- Right before you start cooking it, fry all the vegetables separately with olive oil. Then add some water or broth. Frying will caramelize the sugar in the vegetables and enhance their flavor. The dish will be exquisite and tasty. \n- Regardless of the recipe you follow, always add two tablespoons of sour cream to the mix. This trick suits all kinds of pancakes well, and they turn out to be very tasty, fluffy, and free of cracks. \n- Sugar can be as good a seasoning as salt. Add a bit of sugar to a dish with pickled or fresh tomatoes or a tomato paste. The sugar reduces their natural sourness and makes any meal taste better. \n- The 3 components of perfectly fried eggs are a thick-walled frying pan, butter, and minimum heat. Heat up the frying pan, and add 1/2 tablespoon of butter. It has to melt slowly, not reach a sizzle. Break the eggs, and cook for 4-5 minutes. Add salt, and enjoy perfectly fried eggs.\n- A clear broth is the main component in many soups, sauces, and other dishes. To make a crystal clear broth, you need to cook chicken on a low heat without a cover for at least 3 hours. \n- If you bake at home, you might have faced difficulties with your crust: it's either too pale or too thick. You can solve this problem quite easily by putting a bowl of water into your oven when you bake. Instead of such a bowl, you can use a tray full of ice cubes. \n-Use a medium heat for frying, and add both cooking oil and butter to the heated frying pan. Cut the onions, and fry them with some salt. \n- If you still love to eat it but don't want to frighten away your date or wreck the negotiations, don't add garlic to the dish. Instead, you can apply some garlic juice to the plate. Thus you'll avoid the unpleasant smell and enjoy your favorite flavor. \n\nSubscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur Social Media:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/\n\nSMART Youtube: https://goo.gl/JTfP6L\n\n5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC\n\nHave you ever seen a talking slime?

These secrets will help you to make your dishes taste just as great as Gordon Ramsay's (or even better!). \nHow do restaurant chefs manage to cook delicious culinary masterpieces so fast? Professional chefs usually keep all their cooking tricks a secret and share them only with their students. \n\nTIMESTAMPS\nThe perfect steak 0:47\nThe juiciest meat 1:31\nFlavoring spices 2:24\nLight and airy dough 3:05\nFish with a delicate crust 3:39\nCooking steak without oil 4:13\nCreamy mashed potatoes 4:41\nExcellent cream soup 5:29\nThe best pancakes 6:19\nSugar is not for sweetness 6:51\nThe most difficult one: perfectly fried eggs 7:15\nClear broth 8:10\nCrispy bread crust 9:06\nCook onions correctly 9:46\nDon't be afraid of garlic 10:32\n\nSUMMARY\n- Don't fry a piece of meat that you've just taken out of the fridge. Leave it for an hour or 2 before cooking to let it come up to room temperature. Now you'll fry the meat evenly and get a great meal, regardless of how you like your steak done. \n- It takes time to fry chicken or pork properly, and you can dry them out very easily. To avoid this, many European chefs use a simple trick: they put the meat in a brine. It's very easy to make a good brine: take 3 cups of water, and add ¼ cup of salt and ¼ cup of sugar. Pour the brine into your meat so that the liquid covers it, and put the bowl in a fridge.\n- To extract natural flavors and enhance the taste of the black pepper or cumin in your dish, toss them in a pan over medium heat, toasting them until they're fragrant. After that, you can use a mortar and pestle to grind your spices. \n- If you want to make it perfect, here is a simple rule. Take the butter and eggs out of the fridge the night before to let them come up to room temperature.\n- If you want to fry fish on a grill, spread some mayonnaise on it to get a tasty, delicate crust. Take a pastry brush, dip the tip in the sauce, and lightly apply mayo to the fish. Add some salt, and then grill it. \n- Alain Ducasse, one of the most famous chefs in the world, revealed his secret for cooking a great steak. The steak is placed on its edge because it renders the fat. Now you're able to cook the steak in beef fat, plus it creates a delicious crust on the edges. \n- Before turning boiled potatoes into the mashed ones, you need to dry them properly. Just place them in a clean heated frying pan, and keep them there until the remains of water dry out. Don't let the heat fry them. When the potatoes are dry, you'll get the best creamy mashed potatoes.\n- Right before you start cooking it, fry all the vegetables separately with olive oil. Then add some water or broth. Frying will caramelize the sugar in the vegetables and enhance their flavor. The dish will be exquisite and tasty. \n- Regardless of the recipe you follow, always add two tablespoons of sour cream to the mix. This trick suits all kinds of pancakes well, and they turn out to be very tasty, fluffy, and free of cracks. \n- Sugar can be as good a seasoning as salt. Add a bit of sugar to a dish with pickled or fresh tomatoes or a tomato paste. The sugar reduces their natural sourness and makes any meal taste better. \n- The 3 components of perfectly fried eggs are a thick-walled frying pan, butter, and minimum heat. Heat up the frying pan, and add 1/2 tablespoon of butter. It has to melt slowly, not reach a sizzle. Break the eggs, and cook for 4-5 minutes. Add salt, and enjoy perfectly fried eggs.\n- A clear broth is the main component in many soups, sauces, and other dishes. To make a crystal clear broth, you need to cook chicken on a low heat without a cover for at least 3 hours. \n- If you bake at home, you might have faced difficulties with your crust: it's either too pale or too thick. You can solve this problem quite easily by putting a bowl of water into your oven when you bake. Instead of such a bowl, you can use a tray full of ice cubes. \n-Use a medium heat for frying, and add both cooking oil and butter to the heated frying pan. Cut the onions, and fry them with some salt. \n- If you still love to eat it but don't want to frighten away your date or wreck the negotiations, don't add garlic to the dish. Instead, you can apply some garlic juice to the plate. Thus you'll avoid the unpleasant smell and enjoy your favorite flavor. \n\nSubscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur Social Media:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/\n\nSMART Youtube: https://goo.gl/JTfP6L\n\n5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC\n\nHave you ever seen a talking slime?

It's super fast motion though, so if you are interested in building a primitive log cabin like this, take a look at the \"Log Cabin The Bear Den\" playlist on the channel.\nAt the beginning of the video, I show a winter drone photo of the cabin in the snow in December. Then I flashback to the first balsam fir tree I cut down with a saw and axe near the cabin. I drag the trees into place and clear the cabin site. All summer, I cut the notches in the logs as I built the cabin up, offsite. Once I was finished notching the logs with a log scribe, saw, axe, adze and wood carving gouge, I loaded up the entire cabin of logs and moved them to my land near Algonquin Park, Ontario Canada.\nOnce on site, I spent a month reassembling the cabin on a foundation of sand and gravel. Once the log walls were up, I again used hand tools to shape every log, board and timber to erect the gable ends, the wood roof, the porch, the outhouse and a seemingly endless number of woodworking projects.\nFor the roof, I used an ancient primitive technology to waterproof and preserve the wood - shou sugi ban, a fire hardening wood preservation technique unique to Japan and other areas in northern climates.\nBecause the cabin is offgrid, I have used handtools for most of the build and without power, I have no options on site regardless. The tiny house will continue to be operated with power, not even renewable energy for now, so I'm heating the cabin with a woodstove fire place, which I also cook on.\nThe cabin is made of cedar fence posts, twelve feet long and the cabin measures 10 feet x 20 feet inside with a one hundred square foot sleeping loft on the second floor.\nThe floor is made of two inch thick pine planks, torched to help repel water and to give them a rustic barn board appearance.\n\nTune off sound if you don't want to hear the music, - there is no talking in this silent video. If you are a subscriber or long time viewer, there is some new footage at the end of the video, but otherwise you have seen most of this. As always, I'll release a new video on Friday showing the progress I made this week on the door and the ice box for food storage.\n\nCABIN LIFE MERCHANDISE HERE: https://teespring.com/stores/my-self-reliance\n\nWebsite: http://myselfreliance.com/\nFacebook – https://www.facebook.com/MySelfReliance/\nPersonal Facebook Page (Shawn James) – https://www.facebook.com/shawn.james.msr\nInstagram – https://www.instagram.com/myselfreliance/\n\nMusic \nEternal Hope by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100238\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/\n\n#logcabin #timelapse #shelter","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WmYCUljsrDg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WmYCUljsrDg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WmYCUljsrDg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WmYCUljsrDg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WmYCUljsrDg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"My Self Reliance","tags":["Cabin","self reliance","timelapse","ASMR","my self reliance","log cabin","off-grid","tiny home","shelter","survival","cabin living","alone in the wilderness","shawn james","tiny house","carpentry","diy","canadian","build","the forest","relaxation","meditation","real life","one man","log","cabin","built","in the forest","real","life","log cabin build","how to build a log cabin","wilderness","canada","minecraft IRL","forest","no talking","viral video","shawn james cabin","my self reliance time lapse","my self reliance cabin"],"categoryId":"24","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"Log Cabin TIMELAPSE Built By ONE MAN In The Forest","description":"No talking viral timelapse video of Shawn James off grid log cabin build by one man alone in the wilderness of Canada, from 1st tree I cut to last floor board I laid. \nPlease SUBSCRIBE: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIMXKin1fXXCeq2UJePJEog?sub_confirmation=1\nSo Why Should You Subscribe To My Channel?\n\nTo watch me build my next cabin - bigger and better than this one!..\nTo relax…\nTo virtually immerse yourself in nature…\nTo see how I live debt free, stress free and low cost…\nTo see how I build things alone…\nTo see how I cook with no electricity or gas… \nTo hear what steps I took to retire in my mid-forties so I could live my dream life…\nTo interact with the happiest and most helpful community of viewers on YouTube…\nTo become more self-reliant.\n\nIf you want to build a rustic log cabin or tiny off grid home alone in the wilderness and you haven't seen the rest of my videos, this is a good primer.

His third release in just 12 months, ‘The Iceberg’ is a distillation of stereotypical tropes in hip-hop and beyond, 12 tracks about money, sex, politics, race and religion that appear superficial until his multi-dimensional lyrics unfurl to expose the complexities of individuality and identity: how we see ourselves and how others see us. Deeply soulful, and shot through with jazz, Go-go, gospel, thick r&b and hard beats, the album is a timely, poetic statement. ‘The Iceberg’ is out now on Mello Music Group. \n\nLead single “Things” acts as a mission statement for the album, a deep dance groove with lightning-quick lyrics about “things” he’s going through. Says Oddisee, “\"We all go through the trials & tribulations of life. Why is it we feel the need to individualize our shared experiences?

Hans is a prodigious composer who effortlessly straddles several musical genres so it was liberating for us all to work with such a talent and see how he wove the sound of the series’ and Bloom together.”\n\nIn turn, Hans Zimmer says: “Bloom appears to have been written ahead of its time as it beautifully reflects the jaw-dropping lifeforms and seascapes viewers are introduced to in Blue Planet II.

Experience suggests, though, that it cannot. Why? And is time travel really possible?\n\nClick here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.trib.al/rWl91R7 \n\nWhy does time pass? It is a question so profound that few people would even think to ask it. Yet its effects are all around. Human beings live in a perpetual present, inexorably sealed off from the past, but moving relentlessly into the future. For most people, time seems to be something that is just out there. A thing ticking away in the background - fixed, immutable. Time seems to go in one direction and in one direction only. But physicists see it much differently.\n\nOne of the great minds who changed the way science thinks about time was Albert Einstein. In 1905 he published his special theory of relativity. In it he demonstrated that time passes differently in different places depending on how those places are moving with respect to one another.\n\nEinstein showed that the faster one travels the slower time goes for the traveler. At the speeds at which humans move this is imperceptible. But for someone traveling on a spaceship at speeds close to that of light, time would slow down compared with its passage for people on earth.\n\nThere was another important aspect of Einstein's theory which he didn't even realize when he published it. That time was woven into the very fabric of space itself. Einstein used this insight to help develop his general theory of relativity which incorporated gravity. He published it in 1915. \n\nWith the general theory of relativity he demonstrated that massive objects warped the fabric of space-time. It is this curvature that causes time to slow down near them. Time slows down in proportion to the gravitational pull of a nearby object so the effect would be strong near a black hole but milder near the earth. But even here it can be detected. Einstein's theories had to be taken into account when the GPS system was set up otherwise it would have been inaccurate. \n\nOne scientist who puzzled over the directionality of time was Arthur Eddington, a 20th century astronomer who defined the concept of the arrow of time, based on observations made by the 19th century physicist Ludwig Boltzmann. The arrow of time is based on the second law of thermodynamics which says the disorder known as entropy increases with time. For example, a building left untouched will slowly decay into its surroundings. It will disintegrate into a more chaotic state but it is highly unlikely that the building will become more orderly over time - this is because there are many more ways for a system to be disorderly than orderly. There can be many ways for something to break for instance but only one way for it to be put back together again. A system will be less disordered in the past and more disordered in the future. This is the arrow of time. \n\nSo how can the arrow of time be reconciled with Einstein's equations? If time can go forwards and backwards according to relativity does that mean it's possible to go backwards in time? The theory of relativity does allow time travel to the future.\n\nEinstein's theories do allow for the formation of wormholes in space. These are shortcuts that link otherwise distant places in the space-time continuum. \n\nAlthough wormholes are theoretically possible they're a highly implausible proposition. That's because the equations suggest enormous masses and energies would be required to create and manipulate one. \n\nWhat remains then is a mystery. Theory fails to forbid traveling backwards in time but practice suggests it might just as well be forbidden. For now it would appear the arrow of time cannot be reversed. No one knows why time passes but it seems that no matter how people look at it, it goes in one direction in one direction only.\n\nCheck out Economist Films: http://films.economist.com/ \nCheck out The Economist’s full video catalogue: http://econ.st/20IehQk \nLike The Economist on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheEconomist/ \nFollow The Economist on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theeconomist \nRead our Tumblr: http://theeconomist.tumblr.com/ \nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/theeconomist/ \nCheck out our Pinterest: https://uk.pinterest.com/theeconomist/\nFollow us on LINE: http://econ.st/1WXkOo6","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OKKbkS_LOu4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OKKbkS_LOu4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OKKbkS_LOu4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OKKbkS_LOu4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OKKbkS_LOu4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The Economist","tags":["The Economist","Economist","Economist Films","Economist Videos","Politics","News","short-documentary","why does time pass?","why time passes","time","how time passes","how does time pass","how does time work","time travel","universe","albert einstein","spacetime","special theory of relativity","general theory of relativity","Kip S Thorne","worm holes","arrow of time","Second Law Of Thermodynamics","kip thorne","kip thorne nobel prize","kip thorne interview","physics"],"categoryId":"28","liveBroadcastContent":"none","defaultLanguage":"en-GB","localized":{"title":"Why does time pass? | The Economist","description":"The equations of physics suggest time should be able to go backwards as well as forwards.

There can be many ways for something to break for instance but only one way for it to be put back together again. A system will be less disordered in the past and more disordered in the future. This is the arrow of time. \n\nSo how can the arrow of time be reconciled with Einstein's equations? If time can go forwards and backwards according to relativity does that mean it's possible to go backwards in time? The theory of relativity does allow time travel to the future.\n\nEinstein's theories do allow for the formation of wormholes in space. These are shortcuts that link otherwise distant places in the space-time continuum. \n\nAlthough wormholes are theoretically possible they're a highly implausible proposition. That's because the equations suggest enormous masses and energies would be required to create and manipulate one. \n\nWhat remains then is a mystery. Theory fails to forbid traveling backwards in time but practice suggests it might just as well be forbidden. For now it would appear the arrow of time cannot be reversed. No one knows why time passes but it seems that no matter how people look at it, it goes in one direction in one direction only.\n\nCheck out Economist Films: http://films.economist.com/ \nCheck out The Economist’s full video catalogue: http://econ.st/20IehQk \nLike The Economist on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheEconomist/ \nFollow The Economist on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theeconomist \nRead our Tumblr: http://theeconomist.tumblr.com/ \nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/theeconomist/ \nCheck out our Pinterest: https://uk.pinterest.com/theeconomist/\nFollow us on LINE: http://econ.st/1WXkOo6"}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M30S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"true","licensedContent":true,"projection":"rectangular"},"statistics":{"viewCount":"3043822","likeCount":"41934","dislikeCount":"1378","favoriteCount":"0","commentCount":"4731"},"topicDetails":{"relevantTopicIds":["/m/02jjt","/m/02jjt"],"topicCategories":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment"]}},{"kind":"youtube#video","etag":"\"Fznwjl6JEQdo1MGvHOGaz_YanRU/XgMQ03IK7G9aOuV7MU23DxVq6_0\"","id":"u5JBlwlnJX0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-05-24T16:30:58.000Z","channelId":"UCWTFGPpNQ0Ms6afXhaWDiRw","title":"The Dolly Zoom: More Than A Cheap Trick","description":"The Dolly Zoom is a bizarre cinematic effect, and it can do a lot more than just make you dizzy.

Is it important to add it at certain times? Most recipes (and culinary schools) advise seasoning food with salt early in the cooking process, not just at the end. We decided to investigate this conventional wisdom to see if the timing of seasoning makes a notable difference.\n\nRecipe for Roasted Carrots: http://cooks.io/1yxBofN\nRecipe for Best Beef Stew: http://cooks.io/1yxBsME\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\nWe roasted carrots and prepared beef stew in two ways: For one batch we seasoned the dishes at the very beginning of cooking and, in the case of the beef stew, also when we added the onions. For the other batch we withheld all the measured salt in the recipes and added it at the end.\n\nRESULTS \n\nThe roasted carrot samples were drastically different from one another. Those seasoned before roasting, with 1½ teaspoons of salt, were properly seasoned and flavorful throughout. Meanwhile, the carrots seasoned with the same amount after roasting were seasoned only on their exteriors and also tasted far too salty.\n\nWhen it came to the beef stew, when we salted the meat before cooking (with 1½ teaspoons of salt) and seasoned the onions (with ½ teaspoon of salt) when they went into the pot as directed, the stew and particularly the meat itself were more evenly and deeply seasoned than those in the sample salted only at the finish. Furthermore, as with the carrots, the stew's gravy tasted far too salty when the salt was added at the end.\n\nEXPLANATION\n\nWe know that salt penetrates food slowly when cold. (In a previous experiment, we found that it took 24 hours for salt to diffuse into the center of a refrigerated raw turkey.) While the process is faster during cooking—for example, our science editor noted that the rate of diffusion of salt into meat will double with every 10-degree increase up to the boiling point—it's still not instantaneous. Furthermore, salt penetrates vegetables even more slowly than it does meat (this is because the salt must cross two rigid walls surrounding every plant cell, while the cells in meat contain only one thin wall). Adding salt at the beginning of cooking gives it time to migrate into the pieces of food, seasoning them throughout. Meanwhile, if you add salt only at the end, it provides a more concentrated, superficial coating that immediately hits your tongue.\n\nTAKEAWAY\n\nFor the most even seasoning and well-rounded flavor, we strongly encourage seasoning foods early in the cooking process as we direct in our recipes. However, if you forget, do not make up for it by simply stirring it all in at the end. Instead, start with a very small amount of salt—we used a mere 8 percent of the original amount of salt for the carrots after roasting (⅛ teaspoon versus 1½ teaspoons) and 31 percent for the beef stew (just over ½ teaspoon versus 2 teaspoons)—and then taste and season further as desired. On the flip side, if you are watching your salt intake, you could wait until the end of cooking to season your food, knowing that you'll be able to get away with a lesser amount.\n\nABOUT US: Located in Boston’s Seaport District in the historic Innovation and Design Building, America's Test Kitchen features 15,000 square feet of kitchen space including multiple photography and video studios.

It is also a record label which specialized in releasing classic radio programs and multiple-record box sets. Linnell admits, though, \"I didn't find out what the Longines Symphonette was until after the song was released,\" in a 2009 interview with Rolling Stone.\n\nThe song's video was directed by Adam Bernstein and filmed inside the New York County's Surrogate's Court and Hall of Records building located at 31 Chambers Street in Manhattan. \"I tell people it's my house.\" - Linnell\n\nBlue Canary is the title of a 1953 song by Vincent Fiorino, which has lyrics on the sadder side about loneliness and comforting but has \"happy\" music. Also, the 1948 song \"Bluebird of Happiness\" as performed by Art Mooney (which reminds that, \"Though you're deep in blue, you will see a ray of light creep through\") may have influenced the line about a \"bluebird of friendliness\".\n\n PS: This tidbit from intrepid youtuber \" thatcher81\" : \n\"Fun fact: The first girl mimicking a lighthouse at 1:51 to 1:54 in this video is \"Helen\" from the sitcom \"Wings.\" She is a huge TMBG fan and asked to be in a video (video was filmed when Wings was at its height of popularity)\".\n\nWHILE YOU`RE AT IT, SUBSCRIBE TO THE\nOFFICIAL ' THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS ' YOUTUBE AND FACEBOOK PAGES :\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ParticleMen#p/u\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/theymightbegiants?ref=s\n\n Like it ?

To carry water and make fire I used pots and fire sticks made in this video. Finally, to store fire wood and dry, unfired tiles, I used the wood shed built in this video. \nThe wooden frame was built with a 2X2m floor plan and a 2m tall ridge line with 1m tall side walls. 6 posts were put into the ground 0.25 m deep. The 3 horizontal roof beams were attached to these using mortise and tenon joints carved with a stone chisel. The rest of the frame was lashed together with lawyer cane strips. The frame swayed a little when pushed so later triangular bracing was added to stop this. Also when the mud wall was built, it enveloped the posts and stopped them moving altogether.\nA small kiln was built of mud from the ground and a perforated floor of clay from the creek bank. It was only 25 cm internal diameter and 50 cm tall. Clay was dug, broken tiles (from previous batches) were crushed and added to it as grog and it was mixed thoroughly.This clay was pressed into rectangular moulds made from strips of lawyer cane to form tiles. Wood ash prevented the clay sticking to the stone. 20 tiles were fired at a time. 450 flat tiles and 15 curved ridge tiles were made with only a few breakages. 26 firings were done in all and the average firing took about 4 hours.

The flames travelled beneath the floor heating it. After firing it for a while the stones stay warm all night with heat conducted directly to the sleeping occupant and radiating into the room.\nThe wall was made of clayey mud and stone. A stone footing was laid down and over this a wall of mud was built. To save on mud, stones were included into later wall courses. The mud was dug from a pit in front of the hut and left a large hole with a volume of about 2.5 cubic metres. \nThe finished hut has a swinging door made of sticks. The inside is dark so I made a torch from tree resin. A broken tile with resin on it acts as a small lamp producing a lot of light and little smoke.

The shed houses the very kiln used to fire its own tiles. \nI cut timber using the stone hatchet and took it to the building site. 6 Upright posts were stuck into the ground about half a meter. Mortices were cut into the horizontal beams using a stone chisel to start with, then had there mortices enlarged using hot coals and a blow pipe to burn them out more. These beams were put in place and rafters were lashed on with lawyer cane. The wood that the tiles sit on are about 50 cm apart. The finished frame was 2 x 2 m in floor plan, 2 m tall at the ridge line and 1.5 m tall at the sides. This roof angle is about 22.5 degrees, half the pitch of the huts I usually make. This took about a week but I did it about 4 months ago and left the wood at the site because I was busy on other videos\nNext I made a kiln. I made a basket to make it easier to carry clay from the creek. I dug a trench for the firebox of the kiln and made a clay vault over it using stick arches to support it. Holes were put into the vault to let flames through. The kiln shape was a cube with a domed roof. It was made of mud on site (clay from the creek is too good to build a kiln with and is best used for pottery). Grate bars were put into the firebox to increase wood burning efficiency by letting air come up through the wood rather than over it. This only took about 3 days to build letting it dry slowly.\nTo make the tiles, clay was collected and had the sticks and stones taken out of it. Then I crushed up old broken pottery and tiles I made before which I mixed with the clays as grog (stops clay from cracking). A tile frame was made from a split piece of lawyer cane bent into a trapezoidal shape about 50 cm long, 20 cm at the wide end and 16 cm at the narrow end. This was put on a flat stone. Wood ash was put down to stop the clay sticking to the rock. The clay was pressed into the fame and the wet tile was slid onto a curved piece of wood to form the curved shape of the barrel tile. The tile was then moved immediately to a flat area and the piece of wood was slid out so the tile sat on the ground to dry. Being curved, air could get under the tile to help dry it out. \nI could make 30 tiles easily in a day and only had 150 to make. But it kept raining and destroying the tiles before they dried. So I had to make 30 tiles, let them dry enough to be moved, then take them to the tiled hut where they were force dried on the ondol (fire heated bed). The majority of the time spent on this project was re-making broken tiles due to unseasonal rain (I don’t think we have a proper dry season here anymore, this is what held up my other tiled hut too). So this whole part probably took 4 weeks.\nFiring the tiles was easy compared to the other tiled hut I built. I could fit 30 tiles in the kiln at once and had 150 tiles to fire. The 5 firings took 5, 4.5, 3.5, 4.5 and 3.5 hours. The first one probably took longer due to the kiln not being dry yet and the 4th firing took a while due to wet firewood. Tiling the roof was also easy. Starting at one end, tiles were laid so that the concavity faced up and the narrow end pointed into the next tile below acting like a shoot for water to run down. The gaps between these tiles was covered using a tile with the concavity facing down and the narrow end pointing up under the next tile above. The ridge of the hut was covered with the same tiles interlocking to keep rain out. The low roof pitch, the weight and friction of the tiles, the fact that they interlock all help to keep the tiles in place meaning they don’t need tabs or pegs to hold them in place.\nThe roof sheds rain and is fireproof. This will provide a workplace for fire related projects in all weather. Walls were not built as this is a place for working and storing firewood, not sleeping and staying warm. Also, light can come in so it’s easy to see during work. The kiln worked ok and was able to handle a larger volume of tiles than the previous kiln I built (having over 4 times the volume) though I might investigate better kiln designs in future to attain higher temperatures and use less firewood. The roof of this shed has a lower angle to my other huts meaning it has more headroom. Ideally barrel tiles should be used at about 30 degrees as opposed to the 22.5 I used but being a small shelter I don’t think the water will build up and seep through. A large house would use a slightly steeper angle.\n\nWordpress: https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com/\nPatreon page: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2945881&ty=h\nI have no face book page.

The shed houses the very kiln used to fire its own tiles. \nI cut timber using the stone hatchet and took it to the building site. 6 Upright posts were stuck into the ground about half a meter. Mortices were cut into the horizontal beams using a stone chisel to start with, then had there mortices enlarged using hot coals and a blow pipe to burn them out more. These beams were put in place and rafters were lashed on with lawyer cane. The wood that the tiles sit on are about 50 cm apart. The finished frame was 2 x 2 m in floor plan, 2 m tall at the ridge line and 1.5 m tall at the sides. This roof angle is about 22.5 degrees, half the pitch of the huts I usually make. This took about a week but I did it about 4 months ago and left the wood at the site because I was busy on other videos\nNext I made a kiln. I made a basket to make it easier to carry clay from the creek. I dug a trench for the firebox of the kiln and made a clay vault over it using stick arches to support it. Holes were put into the vault to let flames through. The kiln shape was a cube with a domed roof. It was made of mud on site (clay from the creek is too good to build a kiln with and is best used for pottery). Grate bars were put into the firebox to increase wood burning efficiency by letting air come up through the wood rather than over it. This only took about 3 days to build letting it dry slowly.\nTo make the tiles, clay was collected and had the sticks and stones taken out of it.
